Welcome to LRSCRPM's documentation!
===================================

**LRSCRPM** is an integrative workflow for single cell bioinformatians, biologists, and other researchers
that preprocesses long read single cell RNA-seq data, identifies differential expressed RNA isoforms and genes, and estimates the RNA velocity.
It first uses `BLAZE <https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-023-02907-y>`_
to identify the cell barcodes, which suggest which cell a read comes from.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information.
